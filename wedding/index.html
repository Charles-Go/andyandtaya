      Our wedding, which will be small and intimate, is partly about introducing our close friends
      and family to each other. We recognize the importance of community in forging a strong
      marriage. 
      </p>

      <p>
      Our families love and support us and we have friends who would go to the ends of the earth for
      us, but because this has all happened quickly, many of them don’t know each other. We hope to
      change that in June and, for those in our circles who cannot attend, on our further travels.
      </p>

      <p>
      Because our family and friends span the globe, we had a tough time choosing one place. After
      considering everything from Antarctica to Beirut to Cape Town, we settled on Los Angeles
      because it is our current home and easy for us to plan on a short timeframe. 
      </p>

      <p>
      We hope you will forgive us for not providing much lead time, as we didn't want to wait too
      long (crazy love!). We hope to have celebrations in South Africa and Lebanon later, and to see
      all of you in various places around the globe in the coming year.  
      </p>

      <h3 class="title is-3">RSVP</h3>
      <p>
      Because we have planned to host a limited number of people (70 or so) and have chosen a venue
      that cannot physically accommodate many more, we appreciate your understanding that we cannot
      offer a “plus-one” to all guests. We hope that our friends will enjoy getting to know each
      other and spending quality time with us.
      </p>

      <p>
      If you received an invitation to our Los Angeles wedding, you can reply in one of two ways.
      There is an RSVP link in the email invitation. If you are missing the email, try searching for
      Paperless Post. We also sent paper invitations to those for whom we have physical addresses
      (something to hang on the fridge!). There is a reply card inside with a stamped envelope for
      use within the USA. Thank you!
