      <p>
      Our wedding, which will be small and intimate, is partly about introducing our close friends
      and family to each other. We recognize the importance of community in forging a strong
      marriage. 
      </p>

      <p>
      Our families love and support us and we have friends who would go to the ends of the earth for
      us, but because this has all happened quickly, many of them donâ€™t know each other. We hope to
      change that in June and, for those in our circles who cannot attend, on our further travels.
      </p>

      <p>
      Because our family and friends span the globe, we had a tough time choosing one place. After
      considering everything from Antarctica to Beirut to Cape Town, we settled on Los Angeles
      because it is our current home and easy for us to plan on a short timeframe. 
      </p>

      <p>
      We hope you will forgive us for not providing much lead time, as we didn't want to wait too
      long (crazy love!). We hope to have celebrations in South Africa and Lebanon later, and to see
      all of you in various places around the globe in the coming year.
