      What we want most is to be surrounded by friends and family. If you can be with us on the
      weekend of June 4th, hug us, laugh with us, and witness our commitment, our biggest wish will
      be fulfilled. If you would like to give us a gift other than your presence: 
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
      We will have a table at the dinner and reception Sunday evening where you can write us a
      note, give a card, or leave something you chose or made as a gift.
        </li>

        <li>
      Both of us have spent much of the last phases of our lives as wanderers. We are now settling
      into a life together and if you would like to help us equip our nest with what we need to
      welcome you to visit, eat, and drink with us, we would be grateful. For this, we have
      registered with <a href="https://www.zola.com/registry/andyandtaya" target="_blank">Zola:</a>
        </li>
      </ul>

      Last but not least, you may notice that one of the things on our Zola registry is a charity
      gift. We spent a month in South Africa at the end of 2016 and visited a preschool in one of
      the poorest areas of Soweto that Taya has been involved with as a volunteer for many years. We
      plan to make a contribution to this safe space for children on our next visit to commemorate
      our wedding. 
        </p>

        <p>
      If you would like to participate in reaching out to make a difference across the globe, every
      contribution counts, whether itâ€™s $5 or $50. A $100 contribution sponsors a child to attend
      preschool for a year, where they get access to the foundations of learning as well as a
      nutritional meal every day. We will update all of our guests when we present the donation.
