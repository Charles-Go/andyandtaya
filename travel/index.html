      The closest airport and the one we recommend is Los Angeles International (LAX).

      From the airport, the <a href="http://petitermitage.com/home/" target="_blank">Petit Ermitage Hotel</a> is an approximately
      30-minute drive. 
      </p>
  
      <p>
      Because of very limited parking in both West Hollywood and the beach in Santa Monica, we are
      providing transport from the hotel to the beach ceremony and back. We recommend using
      a rideshare service or a taxi from the airport. There are meet-up points for the rideshare
      services at each terminal, which are different from the location of taxi ranks and may be on
      the departures level. For details:

      The Petit Ermitage Hotel charges $42 per night for Valet parking (with in-and-out
      privileges), which is a similar rate to nearby garages. It is in a residential neighborhood
      where street parking is by permit only.

      We have asked the hotel to set aside a limited number of suites at group rates during the
      weekend. 
      </p>

      <p>
      Suites accommodate two adults in double, queen, or king size beds, with some adding the option
      to have a third person on a sofabed for an additional cost of $35/night. 
      </p>

      <p>
      Rates are between $275 and $320 plus tax and are valid until 2 May 2017. Rates include wifi,
      access to the heated rooftop pool, and various other amenities.

      The Petit Ermitage can arrange child care at the hotel with advanced notice. Please ask for
      assistance and information when booking.
      Children will be welcome at the beach ceremony but we regret not at the evening festivities,
      in part for safety reasons due to the layout of the roof.

      <a href="https://airbnb.com" target="_blank">Airbnb</a> has many options.
      When searching for available listings, we recommend choosing either something close to the
      hotel in West Hollywood or close to the beach in Santa Monica. Please keep in mind that
      traffic in Los Angeles, including (sometimes especially) on weekends, can make even the most local travel very
      slow.
