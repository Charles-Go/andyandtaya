      Children are welcome to the ceremony, which will take place on a public beach in Santa Monica.
      This beach is our special place to walk and enjoy sunsets, as we live nearby. 
      </p>

      <p>
      Vehicles access the beach via the Pacific Coast Highway. On foot, you can reach it by
      pedestrian stairs at several points on Ocean Avenue that lead to walking bridges over the PCH. 
      </p>

      <p>
      There will be three on-site coordinators. However, as it is a public beach, we cannot prevent
      beachgoers from walking past or observing. We simply hope to have them do so respectfully.
      </p>

      On the public beach in front of <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/KBkuM3jy6w22" target="_blank">Annenberg Beach House</a>:

      <p>
      Transportation will be provided from the hotel to the beach and back. There is a long wooden
      pathway which leads right up to the shore where the ceremony will take place. The ceremony
      itself is set up on the sand. There will be a place to leave your shoes if you don’t want to
      carry them.
      </p>

      <p>
      There is a parking lot indicated in the photo above for those who drive on their own. All
      beach parking tends to fill up on weekends, so please plan to arrive early. From the parking
      lot, make your way towards the ocean and you will see the pathway.
      </p>

<p>
If you are early, the <a href="http://backonthebeachcafe.com" target="_blank">Back on the Beach Cafe</a> is located in the spot where the pathway begins so you can have a drink or a snack while you wait.

      We regret no children at the soirée. There is an unsupervised swimming pool that is a safety
      hazard. Childcare can be arranged through the hotel with advanced notice. Please contact the
      hotel directly.

      <b>Attire: </b> Creative Formal 
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>But What Should I Wear?</b>
      Formal attire generally means tuxedos or dark suits for men and long,
      black or neutral colored gowns for women. “Creative Formal” invites you to find your own ways
      of bending these rules should you desire to do so. We are not the fashion police. Petit
      Ermitage is known for bohemian chic and creative self-expression. So feel free to wear a
      glamorous jumpsuit instead of a dress, or add a colorful hat or tie to your suit. The rooftop
      will have a “secret garden” theme, decorated with candles and flowers. There will be long
      communal tables with benches for dinner, room to dance, and a few blanket-strewn cabana
      loungers by the pool to relax.
    </p>

      <h3 class="title is-3">Where?</h3>

      <p>
      Petit Ermitage Hotel, located at {{ site.data.places.hermitage.address}}, on their Private
      Rooftop (4th floor). Rooftop can be accessed by elevator or stairs.
