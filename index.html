      Taya, who runs a wingsuit skydiving school in Southern California, had just decided to
      cancel a trip abroad when a friend put her in touch with someone looking for coaching near
      Los Angeles. Andy was picking up a French visa to start a new software engineering
      job in Paris. Before moving to France, he wanted to improve his flying skills. 
      </p>

      <p>
      During their first day of training at Skydive Perris, Andy asked Taya for more analytical
      feedback about the jumps. It was an unusual request from a skydiver, and the two quickly
      figured out that they had overlapped at Princeton for a year during graduate school. With
      their Ivy League identities unmasked, the conversation picked up pace. 
      </p>

      <p>
      A heat wave hit Southern California that week (you can’t make this stuff up). Andy had
      brought a tent to pitch at the dropzone, which would be boiling by sunrise in the desert.
      Taya suggested an empty room at the house where she was staying. That night, they sat up
      talking for hours. As they retreated to their separate rooms near dawn, both wondered what
      had just happened.
      </p>

      <p>
      Andy stayed on for a few days and started to realize this might be something special. Soon,
      though, he had to leave for Paris. Taya, thinking he would quickly forget her as he started
      his new adventures, refused to hear talk of anything serious.
      </p>

      <p>
      After a rendezvous in Amsterdam and Belgium where she traveled for work in July, Taya
      started to believe maybe Andy was right. Sure enough, he showed up in LA again in August.
      After that visit, the two had plans that kept them apart for 6 weeks. They reasoned that
      the separation would be a test of how they really felt. 
      </p>
       
      <p>
      In October, reunited at Charles de Gaulle airport, they ran into each other’s arms and never
      wanted to let go. A week later, barely four months after they had first met, Andy got down
      on one knee and proposed under the Eiffel Tower. To the delight of the small crowd that had
      gathered in the park on that beautiful Saturday afternoon, a tearful Taya said yes.
      </p>

      <p>
      Not long afterwards, Andy packed up his bags in Paris and after a stop in Boston to meet
      Taya’s family, moved with her to Santa Monica. There, they are doing the best two itinerant
      citizens of the world can do to build a home together.
